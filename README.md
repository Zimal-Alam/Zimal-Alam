👋 Hi there! I'm Zimal Alam, a recent Data Science graduate at FAST NUCES with a passion for building AI-powered solutions that bridge the gap between data and real-world impact.

🔍 I specialize in Generative AI, NLP, and machine learning, with hands-on experience in designing end-to-end data pipelines, predictive models, and intelligent applications across domains like healthcare, finance, and voice interfaces.

🧠 My toolkit includes:

Languages: Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, C++, HTML/CSS

Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, YOLO, Transformers, LangChain, Flask, Streamlit, React, Node.js, D3.js

Platforms/Tools: GitHub, Tableau, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Google Colab, PyCharm

🚀 Some of my key projects:

VoxAI SQL: Voice-to-SQL chatbot built with LangChain and Flan-T5 for natural language query generation

Fire & Smoke Detection: CNN-based detection system with edge deployment capability

Stock Prediction: LSTM-based model for time-series forecasting

Med-Bot: NLP-powered chatbot for medical assistance

Data Warehouse Creation: Designed complete ETL pipeline with analytical reporting

Drowsy Driver Alert System: Real-time OpenCV application for safety monitoring

📊 I'm always exploring new technologies in AI integration, LLMs, data engineering, and automation. Let’s build something smart and meaningful together!
